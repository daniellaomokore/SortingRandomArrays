# SortingRandomArrays
# Number sorting program for random arrays

#Task:
Create a random 100 x 100 array, sort the odd rows in decsending order and even rows in ascending order Do this with two different sorting algorithms without using inbuilt functions and find the running times for the different sorting algorithms

#Criteria:
-Don't use built-in functions
-Use one sorting algorithm based on brute-force strategy to sort the whole array and test the running time for 10 instances of random arrays.
-Use another sorting algorithm with different complexity from the previous one to sort the whole array and test the running time for 10 instances of random arrays.
